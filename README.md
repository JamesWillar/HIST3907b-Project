# HIST3907b-Project
My final project for HIST3907b, the Data Mining and Visualization course at Carleton University under the supervision of Dr. Shawn Graham
The idea behind this project is to find out what perception Canadians have of other nations and with what topics they associate them with. The plan is to look through the national newspapers of the past 100 years and find references to the other countries and see the context and frequency of each. I can then run these findings through something like Voyant Tools to get a better look at how it all fits together. Hopefully there will be a meaningful change over time in how different countries are perceived along with historical events. What I am really hoping to find is a difference between the story that is told to us in retrospect and the actual world that the people of the time were living in.
